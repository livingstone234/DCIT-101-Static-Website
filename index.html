            <h1>COD WWII PLAY TIME</h1>
            <p class="par">Call of Duty: WWII is a 2017 first-person shooter game developed by Sledgehammer Games and published by Activision.<br> It was released worldwide on November 3, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is the fourteenth main installment in the Call of Duty series and the first title in the series to be set primarily during World War II since Call of Duty: World at War in 2008.<br>

                <br>The player controls Ronald "Red" Daniels, who has squadmates who can supply the player with extra ammunition, health, or grenades as well as a targeted grenade and target spotting; none of these are automatically replenished in the campaign.<br>
                
                Sledgehammer Games were interested in bringing the series back to World War II after developing their previous title, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare (2014), which featured advanced movements and futuristic warfare technology. <br>They also chose to include atrocities and Nazi concentration camps in the campaign mode to deliver an authentic war story.
                
                <br>Upon release, the game received generally positive reviews from critics. <br>Praise was given towards its story, the combat support of squad members and lack of regenerating health, multiplayer modes, and visuals. <br>However, it was criticized for the single-player's lack of innovation and similarity to past games set in the same era.</p>
